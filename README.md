# Address the Toil in the Ticketing System

## Strategies to Mitigate Recurring Obsolete Alerts

To effectively address the challenge of recurring obsolete alerts in your ticketing system, consider the following strategies:

- **Review and Cleanse**: Regularly review the current alerts and deactivate those that have not been triggered in the past six months.
- **Refinement and Adjustment**: Continuously refine alert parameters to ensure they align with their original intent and do not generate false alarms.
- **Scalability Based on Data**: Adjust alert thresholds based on insights drawn from log data to better match real-world conditions.
- **Testing Environments**: Establish a dedicated testing environment to validate and fine-tune alerts before they go live.
- **Dashboard Unification**: Consolidate group alerts into a single dashboard using tools like Grafana or similar platforms for better visibility and management.

## Strategies to Mitigate Lack of Prioritization

Addressing the lack of prioritization in your ticketing system can be achieved by implementing these approaches:

- **Enhanced Ticket Systems**: Utilize advanced ticketing systems that support automated prioritization and management features.
- **Stakeholder Meetings (STUM)**: Regularly engage with business teams through Stakeholder Team-Up Meetings (STUM) to collaboratively prioritize tasks and align on business impacts.

## Recommended Tools

To support these strategies, the following tools are recommended:

- **Jira**: For comprehensive issue and project tracking.
- **PagerDuty**: For real-time incident management and alerting.
- **Prometheus**: For monitoring and alert generation based on customizable metrics.
- **Grafana**: For creating actionable dashboards from diverse data sources.

Implementing these tools and strategies will help you mitigate issues related to obsolete alerts and lack of prioritization in your ticketing system.
